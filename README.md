# ⚗️ Melanie screen GEMs

## 📕 Description

This repo contains inputs, outputs, and step-by-step details regarding how models were reconstructed for strains used in Melanie's screen.

## 🧱 Materials

* `genomes` DNA fasta files for 40 NCBI strains used in experimental screen
* `media` Growth media formulations used for gapfilling and simulation
* `proteomes` Open reading frame (ORF)-annotated protein fasta files
* `ensembles` Ensemble models for network uncertainty quantification
* `models` Genome scale metabolic models gapfilled on various media

## 🩺 Methods

1. Translate genomes to ORF-annotated protein fasta files using prodigal

```

```

2. Create genome scale metabolic models using CarveMe
